## Videos Tracker CLI in Python

1. This project helps track video data in a file, ensuring it is saved even after the program is closed

2. It uses sqlite3 as a database for accessing data with same functionality but with cleaner code

3. It uses mongodb to fetch and manipulate data. Instead of using mongdb atlas or a local mongo server I used docker mongo.
